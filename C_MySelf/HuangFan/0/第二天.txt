第一天翻译的答案：  Chinese parents tend to pay too much attention to their children's 
                 study to such an extent that they even don't require their children to 
                 help them do the chores.Their primary requirement for their children is 
                 to study hard,get good grades and go to famous universities.They believe
                 this does good to their children because in Chinese society which is full 
                 of intense competitio,only perfect academic performance can ensure a bright 
                 future.Chinese parents also believe if their children can make great 
                 achievements in the society,they will receieve respect acordingly.Therefore,
                 they are willing to sacrifice their own time,hobbies and interests to provide 
                 better conditions for their children.
